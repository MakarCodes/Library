# Library
The purpose of this project is to hook up html, css and js skills, which I've learned and create small library using objects. 
Each book will be created by constructor and stored in an array. 
User should be able to adding and removing books by filling up the form with some required data.
Each book will have "read" status. Additionally, there will be possibility to search books by titles.
Eventually, local storage will be added to avoid disappearing of the books when the user refreshes the page.
